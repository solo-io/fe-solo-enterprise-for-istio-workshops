# Cross-Cluster gRPC Load Balancing

# Objectives
- Deploy a gRPC client and a 4-replica server across `cluster1` and `cluster2`
- Expose the server as a global service
- Reproduce gRPC connection pinning across the cluster boundary
- Attach a waypoint to the `grpc-server` Service in the cluster that holds the endpoints
- Restore per-request load balancing across the boundary and trace the path

## Prerequisites
- This lab assumes you have completed setup from labs `000-006`. The two clusters must be linked and `./solo-istioctl multicluster check` must pass. Traffic in this lab uses the east-west gateways created in lab `006`.

Ensure the following environment variables are set:
```bash
export KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER1=cluster1  # Replace with your actual kubectl context name

export KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER2=cluster2  # Replace with your actual kubectl context name
```

## Background

gRPC multiplexes many requests over one long-lived HTTP/2 connection, and Kubernetes load balances
*connections*, so every request a client sends over that connection lands on the same pod. The
[single-cluster version of this lab](../istio-ambient-single-cluster/010-grpc-loadbalancing.md) reproduces
that pinning in detail and fixes it with a waypoint on a single-cluster environment

This lab runs the same experiment across a global mesh. The client runs on `cluster1` and the 4-replica server on `cluster2`, where a
single `solo.io/service-scope=global` label publishes the server at `grpc-server.grpcdemo.mesh.internal` in
every peered cluster. A waypoint can then be used to enable per-request load balancing.

Both workloads use **Istio's echo app** (`docker.io/istio/app`), the same app Istio's own multicluster integration tests drive. Two of its properties do the work in this lab:

- Its responses carry `Hostname=`, so the client output tells you which pod served each request.
- Its responses also carry `Cluster=`, so you can confirm each request crossed the cluster boundary.

## Deploy the client and server across two clusters

Create the `grpcdemo` namespace on both clusters and enroll it in the ambient mesh:
```bash
for context in $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER1 $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER2; do
  kubectl create ns grpcdemo --context $context --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply --context $context -f -
  kubectl label ns grpcdemo istio.io/dataplane-mode=ambient --overwrite --context $context
done
```

Deploy the client on `cluster1`:
```bash
kubectl apply -f grpc/grpc-client.yaml -n grpcdemo --context $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER1
kubectl rollout status deploy/grpc-client -n grpcdemo --context $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER1
```

Deploy the 4-replica server on `cluster2`. The manifest passes `--cluster=$(CLUSTER_NAME)`, which Kubernetes expands from the container's environment, so the serving cluster shows up in every response:
```bash
kubectl apply -f grpc/grpc-server.yaml -n grpcdemo --context $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER2
kubectl set env deploy/grpc-server -n grpcdemo CLUSTER_NAME=$KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER2 --context $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER2
kubectl rollout status deploy/grpc-server -n grpcdemo --context $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER2
```

> **The `grpc-server` Service port has to declare gRPC.** The manifest sets `appProtocol: grpc` and names
> the port `grpc`. Either signal tells Istio to parse HTTP/2 off the connection. Without one, a waypoint
> treats the stream as opaque TCP and pins every request to one pod. A global service carries the port
> definition to the peered clusters, so you set this only where the Service is defined.

`cluster1` holds only the client, with no `grpc-server` Deployment or Service at all:
```bash
kubectl get pods,svc -n grpcdemo --context $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER1
```

## Make the server reachable

### Neither hostname resolves

There is no `grpc-server` on `cluster1`, so the ordinary cluster-local name has nothing to resolve to:
```bash
kubectl exec -n grpcdemo deploy/grpc-client --context $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER1 -- \
  /usr/local/bin/client --count 1 grpc://grpc-server:7070
```

```sh
fatal	Error 1/1 requests had errors; first error: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = connection error:
desc = "transport: Error while dialing: dial tcp: lookup grpc-server on 10.109.68.100:53: no such host"
```

Dialing the global hostname `grpc-server.grpcdemo.mesh.internal:7070` fails the same way. Peering the clusters in lab `006` did not make their services mutually reachable: services stay cluster-scoped until you label them global.

### Expose it as a global service

Apply the `solo.io/service-scope=global` label to the `grpc-server` service on `cluster2`. This generates a `ServiceEntry` for the hostname `grpc-server.grpcdemo.mesh.internal` in **every** peered cluster, aggregating the endpoints of each cluster that hosts the service:
```bash
kubectl label svc grpc-server -n grpcdemo solo.io/service-scope=global --overwrite --context $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER2
```

Confirm the global `ServiceEntry` reached both clusters:
```bash
for context in $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER1 $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER2; do
  echo "--- $context ---"
  kubectl get serviceentry -n istio-system --context $context | grep -E "NAME|grpc-server"
done
```

Both clusters report it, even though only `cluster2` has a `grpc-server` Service. Consuming a global
service requires no local copy, so `cluster1` needs no `grpc-server` Deployment and no placeholder
Service. It learns the hostname over the peering established in lab `006` and generates the
`ServiceEntry` itself:
```sh
NAME                         HOSTS                                    LOCATION        RESOLUTION   AGE
autogen.grpcdemo.grpc-server ["grpc-server.grpcdemo.mesh.internal"]   MESH_INTERNAL   STATIC       5s
```

Dial the global hostname and count by cluster:
```bash
kubectl exec -n grpcdemo deploy/grpc-client --context $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER1 -- \
  /usr/local/bin/client --count 100 grpc://grpc-server.grpcdemo.mesh.internal:7070 \
  | grep Cluster= | sed 's/.*Cluster=//' | sort | uniq -c
```

All 100 requests cross the boundary. `cluster2` here is the `CLUSTER_NAME` value you set on the server deployment, echoed back in every response:
```sh
 100 cluster2
```

## Pinned at L4, across the boundary

Reachability works. Now look at *which* pods serve the traffic.

A typical gRPC client connects once and multiplexes every request over that connection. Send 100 requests and count by server pod; piping through `sort | uniq -c` collapses the output:
```bash
kubectl exec -n grpcdemo deploy/grpc-client --context $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER1 -- \
  /usr/local/bin/client --count 100 \
  grpc://grpc-server.grpcdemo.mesh.internal:7070 \
  | grep Hostname= | sed 's/.*Hostname=//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

All 100 requests land on a single pod:
```sh
 100 grpc-server-54f6774b64-j49mq
```

No L7 proxy sits anywhere in this path. ztunnel balances at L4, per *connection*, and the client opened exactly one. ztunnel gives that connection mTLS and L4 authorization, then forwards the whole stream to a single endpoint, so the four-replica deployment serves like one pod.

Tools like `grpcurl` open a fresh connection per invocation, so each probe lands on a different pod and a quick test looks healthy. The pinning shows only under a client that holds its connection open.

## Configure a waypoint for load balancing

In Ambient, a waypoint load balances only over endpoints in its own cluster, so put it where the endpoints
are: in `cluster2`, alongside the four pods. Deploy it into `grpcdemo` there and attach it to the
`grpc-server` Service:
```bash
kubectl apply --context $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER2 -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: waypoint
  namespace: grpcdemo
spec:
  gatewayClassName: istio-waypoint
  listeners:
  - name: mesh
    port: 15008
    protocol: HBONE
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: All
EOF
kubectl rollout status deploy/waypoint -n grpcdemo --context $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER2
kubectl label svc grpc-server -n grpcdemo istio.io/use-waypoint=waypoint --overwrite --context $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER2
```

The `istio.io/use-waypoint=waypoint` label marks `grpc-server` on `cluster2` as reached through that waypoint, and the global hostname resolves to that same Service. `cluster1`'s ztunnel still sends the client's connection across the boundary at L4, and `cluster2` now delivers it to the waypoint instead of straight to a pod.

> **Granular control.** `istio.io/use-waypoint` applies at the namespace level or per service. In this case we
> know which component needs request-level load balancing, so we scope the label to `grpc-server` and leave everything
> else in `grpcdemo` on ztunnel's L4 path, without an L7 hop it has no use for. A Service label overrides a
> namespace label in either direction, so you can carve a single service out of a namespace-wide waypoint, or
> into one.

Re-run the test that pinned all 100 requests. You have not reconfigured or restarted the client:
```bash
kubectl exec -n grpcdemo deploy/grpc-client --context $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER1 -- \
  /usr/local/bin/client --count 100 grpc://grpc-server.grpcdemo.mesh.internal:7070 \
  | grep Hostname= | sed 's/.*Hostname=//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

One connection carrying 100 multiplexed requests now reaches four pods in another cluster:
```sh
  29 grpc-server-54f6774b64-lz4t5
  25 grpc-server-54f6774b64-j49mq
  24 grpc-server-54f6774b64-f6nm6
  22 grpc-server-54f6774b64-2wjpk
```

`cluster2` reports the endpoints its waypoint balances across:
```bash
./solo-istioctl ztunnel-config service --service-namespace grpcdemo --context $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER2
```

```sh
NAMESPACE SERVICE NAME                 SERVICE VIP             WAYPOINT ENDPOINTS
grpcdemo  autogen.grpcdemo.grpc-server 240.240.0.19,2001:2::13 waypoint 4/4
grpcdemo  autogen.grpcdemo.waypoint    240.240.0.20,2001:2::14 None     1/1
grpcdemo  grpc-server                  10.110.219.34           waypoint 4/4
grpcdemo  waypoint                     10.109.159.166          None     1/1
```

`ENDPOINTS 4/4`, one per backend pod, and the waypoint balances evenly across all of them.

## Trace the path

The request path is now: client pod → `cluster1` ztunnel → `cluster2` east-west gateway → `cluster2` ztunnel → **`cluster2` waypoint** → server pod. The source ztunnel dials the *remote* cluster's east-west gateway directly, so the client's connection crosses the boundary at L4 and nothing terminates it until it reaches the waypoint next to the backends.

![](../images/grpc-loadbalancing-1.png)

Send another 100 requests, then read the `cluster2` ztunnel log:
```bash
kubectl exec -n grpcdemo deploy/grpc-client --context $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER1 -- \
  /usr/local/bin/client --count 100 grpc://grpc-server.grpcdemo.mesh.internal:7070 > /dev/null

# The waypoint holds its backend connections open for a 5s idle timeout after the
# client exits. Without this wait the log lines below do not exist yet.
sleep 8

kubectl logs -n istio-system -l app=ztunnel --context $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER2 --since=60s --prefix \
  | grep "connection complete" | grep 'src.workload="waypoint'
```

One connection per server pod, each carrying the **`cluster2`** waypoint's SPIFFE identity in `src.identity`. The waypoint terminated the client's connection and opened its own to each backend:
```sh
src.workload="waypoint-77f666585d-csj8l" src.identity="spiffe://cluster2.local/ns/grpcdemo/sa/waypoint" dst.workload="grpc-server-54f6774b64-j49mq" bytes_sent=12255
src.workload="waypoint-77f666585d-csj8l" src.identity="spiffe://cluster2.local/ns/grpcdemo/sa/waypoint" dst.workload="grpc-server-54f6774b64-2wjpk" bytes_sent=12255
src.workload="waypoint-77f666585d-csj8l" src.identity="spiffe://cluster2.local/ns/grpcdemo/sa/waypoint" dst.workload="grpc-server-54f6774b64-lz4t5" bytes_sent=11776
src.workload="waypoint-77f666585d-csj8l" src.identity="spiffe://cluster2.local/ns/grpcdemo/sa/waypoint" dst.workload="grpc-server-54f6774b64-f6nm6" bytes_sent=12734
```

`connection complete` logs only when a connection closes, which is what the `sleep` above waits for: the waypoint keeps each backend connection open for a 5s idle timeout after the client exits, so the lines carry `duration="5s"` and appear about five seconds late. Before the waypoint, this same log showed a single line carrying the *client's* identity, `spiffe://cluster1.local/ns/grpcdemo/sa/default`, to one pod: the connection reached the backend untouched. The waypoint now terminates it and opens its own to each of the four.

## Cleanup

Remove the namespace from both clusters, which takes the waypoints, the apps, and the labels with it:
```bash
for context in $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER1 $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER2; do
  kubectl delete ns grpcdemo --context $context --ignore-not-found
done
```

Istio garbage collects the autogenerated `ServiceEntry` objects in `istio-system` once the services are gone. Confirm:
```bash
for context in $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER1 $KUBECONTEXT_CLUSTER2; do
  kubectl get serviceentry -n istio-system --context $context | grep grpc-server
done
```

Both commands should return nothing.

In the next lab `016` you migrate a service between clusters while clients keep its cluster-local hostname. If you would like to clean up all workshop resources instead, see `017` for cleanup instructions.
