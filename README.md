# Solo Enterprise for Istio Workshops

Hands-on workshops for deploying and operating **Solo Enterprise for Istio** with Ambient Mesh. Workshops cover zero-trust security, ingress, egress control, observability, multi-cluster routing, and global service discovery using the Bookinfo sample application.

## Workshops

| Workshop | Platform | Clusters | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`istio-ambient-single-cluster`](istio-ambient-single-cluster/) | Standard Kubernetes | 1 | Single-cluster ambient mesh on standard Kubernetes — zero trust, ingress, egress, waypoints, observability, Solo Management UI, gRPC load balancing, VM integration. |
| [`istio-ambient-single-cluster-on-openshift`](istio-ambient-single-cluster-on-openshift/) | OpenShift | 1 | Single-cluster ambient mesh on OpenShift — ingress, egress, waypoints, observability with OpenShift User Workload Monitoring, Solo Management UI. |
| [`istio-ambient-multicluster-on-openshift`](istio-ambient-multicluster-on-openshift/) | OpenShift | 2 | Ambient mesh across two OpenShift clusters — multicluster routing, global service discovery, failover, segments, global aliases, zero-trust access control, egress, waypoints, observability, Solo Management UI. |
| [`istio-ambient-multicluster`](istio-ambient-multicluster/) | Standard Kubernetes | 2 | Ambient mesh across two standard Kubernetes clusters — multicluster routing, global service discovery, failover, segments, global aliases, zero-trust access control, egress, waypoints, observability, Solo Management UI, cross-cluster gRPC load balancing, service migration between clusters with service takeover. |
| [`istio-oss-sidecar-to-enterprise-ambient`](istio-oss-sidecar-to-enterprise-ambient/) | Standard Kubernetes | 1 | In-place migration from OSS Istio sidecar to Solo Enterprise Ambient, ingress, egress, waypoints, observability, zero-trust access control |

## Reference

| Page | Description |
|---|---|
| [`reference/ambient-ports.md`](reference/ambient-ports.md) | Every port an ambient mesh uses, grouped by data plane, telemetry, and control plane. The list to hand to whoever owns your firewalls, security groups, and `NetworkPolicy`. |
