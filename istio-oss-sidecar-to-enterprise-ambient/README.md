# OSS Istio Sidecar to Solo Enterprise Ambient Workshop

A hands-on migration workshop: start with open-source Istio in **sidecar mode** (a common production starting point), deploy the Bookinfo sample application with sidecar injection, then perform an **in-place upgrade** to Solo Enterprise Istio Ambient. Experience what a real production migration looks like — including the coexistence period and namespace-by-namespace migration pattern.

## Workshop Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | Kubernetes (single cluster) |
| **Starting point** | OSS Istio 1.29.5 (sidecar mode) |
| **Target** | Solo Istio 1.30.5-solo (ambient mode) |

## Three-Phase Journey

| Phase | Labs | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1 — Start with OSS Istio** | `001`–`003` | Install community Istio in sidecar mode, deploy Bookinfo, expose via ingress |
| **Phase 2 — Migrate to Solo Ambient** | `004`–`005` | In-place upgrade to Solo Istio Ambient; migrate namespaces from sidecar → ambient |
| **Phase 3 — Zero-Trust & L7** | `006`–`009` | AuthorizationPolicy, waypoints, traffic management, observability, egress control |

## Key Teaching Moments

- **Before migration:** Bookinfo pods show `2/2 READY` (app + Envoy sidecar)
- **After migration:** Bookinfo pods show `1/1 READY` (app only — ztunnel handles mTLS at the node level)
- **During coexistence:** Both sidecar and ambient workloads run simultaneously — the upgrade is non-disruptive

## Versions

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| OSS Istio (start) | 1.29.5 |
| Solo Istio (target) | 1.30.5-solo |
| Gateway API | v1.5.0 |
| Kubernetes | ≥ 1.29 |

## Prerequisites

- A valid Solo.io license key (`$SOLO_TRIAL_LICENSE_KEY`)
- `helm`
- A Kubernetes cluster ≥ 1.29
- `openssl` (macOS/Linux built-in; Windows users: WSL or Git Bash)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Obtain a Solo.io trial license key
3. Change into this directory. Every lab runs its commands relative to it (`kubectl apply -f bookinfo/...`, `./solo-istioctl`):
   ```bash
   cd istio-oss-sidecar-to-enterprise-ambient
   ```
4. Follow the labs in order starting with `000-introduction.md`

## Reference

- [Ports used in an Istio ambient mesh](../reference/ambient-ports.md): what to open on firewalls, cloud security groups, and `NetworkPolicy`.
